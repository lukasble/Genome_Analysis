# Genome_Analysis
This is a log for the genome analysis.

1/4-25: Started working on the project plan  
2/4-25: Wrote most of the project plan  
3/4-25: Finalized the project plan  
7/4-25: Ran FastQC to check the quality of DNA and RNA reads. Ran Trimmomatic on the RNA reads and FastQC again to assess the quality.
10/4-25: Finished the assembly with Megahit and started quality check with Quast 
22/4-25: Ran mapping of DNA reads (and also made a depth file), then did binning with Metabat
28/4-25: Checked the quality of the bins with CheckM
2/5-25: Used the program Prokka fro annotation and GTDB-Tk for phylogeny
5/5-25: Finished RNA mapping with bwa and then used HTSeq 
9/5-25: Made an attempt with Eggnog mapper for metabolic pathways 
14/5-25: Made an abundant analysis
20/5-25: Finishing up the wiki
23/5-25: Finished the wiki
